Scribble is a group project for a software engineering class at Loyola University Maryland.  The goal was to create a networked game of pictionary played in teams.

In order to play, you must have a server running on a computer that other people can reach.

The group for this project was made up of the following people, all of whom wrote code:
Chas Albro
Ken Bayron
Steve Jean
Chris Ridgely
Billy Robbins
